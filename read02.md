How does pair programming work?
While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration

3. Learning from fellow students

## javaScript and jQuery
HTML 5  EVENTS :
Events  are the browsers way of telling  whensomething has happened (like  when  button has been clicked).
Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon.
When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.
You can use event delegation to monitor for events
that happen on all of the children of an element.
The most commonly used events are W3C DOM
events, although there are others in the HTMLS
specification as well as browser-specific events.
  

  ## JQery
  simple way to achieve a variety of common
JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major
browsers and without any fallback code needed
 we should include the java script file in the end of the body  
 WHY USE JQUERY? 
 bec it`s easier and if u have a code and write in in pure Js and write the same code with jqery it would be much easier and simplier and less lines of code 
   the clone methode we use it to copyy  
   we can change the dimantion by using .hight and .width
