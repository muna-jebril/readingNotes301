## Call stack


A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.
## Understanding the JavaScript call stack

The JavaScript engine (which is found in a hosting environment like the browser), is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack. The browser provides web APIs like the DOM, AJAX, and Timers.

This article is aimed at explaining what the call stack is and why it is needed. An understanding of the call stack will give clarity to how “function hierarchy and execution order” works in the JavaScript engine.

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

## summery
The key takeaways from the call stack are:
1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. It works as a LIFO — Last In, First Out data structure.

## JavaScript error messages && debugging
Most of your time as a developer is spent reading code followed by debugging that same code, most likely to be able to read it or solve an “unexpected feature” (which, joking aside, is more correctly known as a “bug”).

Types of error messages
The first thing that indicates you that something is wrong with your code is the (in)famous error message that the one we saw just moments ago, it usually appears on your console (being developer tools of the browser, terminal or whatever else you are using).
For those already used to programming, reading an error message is like second nature, for everybody else, is something you learn either you like it or not so might as well talk a bit about each of them.
Reference errors
This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.
